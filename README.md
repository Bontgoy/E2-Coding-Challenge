Write code that will track the growth of a Utopian Tree.

Rules and Constraints
---
-	A Utopian Tree when planted will have the height of 1 meter.
-	Each year holds 2 growth cycles.
	-	Spring - At this time the tree doubles in size.
	-	Summer - This seasons yields growth of 1 meter.
-	The Tree is always planted just before the Spring growth cycle. (this could easily be changed with spring and summer panting methods.)
